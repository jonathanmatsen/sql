#### VALUE CHECKING (STEP 5)

Moving on to next problem for times' sake, but got stuck on:
- how to calcualte average_value_sales_per_customer
- using the CASE method technique to force all the countries with 1 customer into an aggregate 'other' category

%%sql
SELECT *
FROM invoice_line il
INNER JOIN invoice i ON i.invoice_id = il.invoice_id;


%%sql
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id),
    SUM(i.total)
FROM invoice i
INNER JOIN customer c ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
WHERE c.country = 'Czech Republic';
